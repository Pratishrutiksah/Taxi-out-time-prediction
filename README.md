# Taxi-out-time-prediction
# Primary goal of project
Efficient airport operations are critical to the aviation industry's success, with taxi-out time—a key metric—playing a pivotal role. Taxi-out time refers to the duration an aircraft spends moving from its gate to the takeoff runway. It impacts overall airport throughput, fuel efficiency, and environmental sustainability.
# Objectives
This report aims to analyze and understand the factors influencing taxi-out time of aircrafts. By examining a comprehensive dataset encompassing various operational and environmental variables, the goal is to uncover insights that can optimize airport operations and enhance flight efficiency.
# Methodology
Utilizing advanced statistical methods and machine learning techniques, this report examines correlations between these factors and taxi-out times. Predictive modeling will be employed to forecast taxi-out times based on historical data and environmental conditions.
